    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>=></strong> I'm a creative developer specializing in 3D design, animations, and interactive websites.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> Hello! <strong>I'm Shreyan</strong>, a passionate developer and 3D designer dedicated to creating immersive and interactive digital experiences. With a strong background in web development and a keen interest in emerging technologies, I aim to combine creativity and technical skills to build projects that are both visually captivating and highly functional.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> I am 18 year old, <strong>B.Tech student</strong> studying in <strong>Saveetha Institute of Medical And Technical Sciences.</strong>I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. I can't stop learning new things; the more, the better.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> My journey began with a fascination for how technology and design could transform ideas into reality. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, specializing in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and various frameworks like React and Vue.js. I’ve also developed a deep interest in 3D modeling and animation, working with tools like Blender and Unity to create interactive environments and dynamic visual content.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> I believe that design is not just about aesthetics, but also about delivering a seamless user experience. My design philosophy is rooted in user-centric principles: understanding how people interact with digital products and ensuring that each interaction feels intuitive, enjoyable, and efficient. My projects blend form and function, incorporating engaging visuals while maintaining responsiveness and accessibility across mobile and desktop devices.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> In this portfolio, you’ll find a <strong>range of projects showcasing my expertise in 3D modeling, animation, and web design.</strong> Each project reflects my commitment to detail and innovation, whether it's building a responsive website, crafting a 3D interactive experience, or developing user-friendly applications. I take pride in constantly exploring new techniques and technologies, and I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of digital design.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> Beyond my technical skills, I’m an avid learner. I actively engage with design communities, participate in workshops, and stay updated on the latest trends and tools. My goal is to continue evolving as a designer and developer, working on projects that challenge me creatively and technically.</p>
    <p><strong>=></strong> I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio. Let’s connect and collaborate on building innovative digital experiences that inspire and leave a lasting impact!</p>
